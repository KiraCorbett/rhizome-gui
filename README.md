# Rhizome: Towards An Information Centric OS Shell

A graphical representation of the [Rhizome API](https://github.com/ybakos/rhizome-dart),
a new information-centric operating system shell for humans.

[Honors College Thesis](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/honors_college_theses/3t945z87r) Rhizome is an information-centric model that uses different interaction methods than traditional desktop systems. I built Rhizome with the specific use case of sharing a photo to observe people using the Rhizome operating system (OS) shell and modern OS shells. The purpose of this is to measure the cognitive load each OS shell has on a its users. Moving further from the traditional WIMP model seems to create more promising results and fruitful experiences for users. The results indicate that people were 60% more efficient on average in completing their task using Rhizome instead of a traditional WIMP model.
